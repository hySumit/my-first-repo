## 1. Basic Instructions that i have followed to create this repository. ->

1. Created a new public repository and Named it to 
"my-first-repo."

2. Then i Cloned it to my local (Pc) using the Gitbash terminal. the command for cloning repository is ~ 
`git clone` https://github.com/hySumit/my-first-repo.git

3. Inside this repository i created another file called "hello.txt."

4. Added a greeting message (e.g., "Hello, GitHub!") to the "hello.txt" file. and *Saved it.*


## 2. Staging and Committing Changes ->

1. Used the `git status` command to check the status of the repository. and saw it was just created and not staged.

2. Used the `git add .hello.txt` command to stage the changes i have made to "hello.txt." file.

3. Again i used the `git status` command to verify that the changes are staged or not.
4. Used the `git commit -m "Added greeting to hello.txt"` command to commit the staged changes.

## 3. Pushing Changes to GitHub ->

1. Used the `git push` command to push my committed changes to my GitHub repository.

2. Visited my GitHub repository in a web browser and verified that the "hello.txt" file and my commit message are visible or not. 

## 4. Creating a New Branch
1. Used the `git branch feature/additional-greeting.` command to create a new branch in the repository.

2. Used the `git checkout feature/additional-greeting` command to switch to that new branch.

3. Used the `git branch` command again to confirm that i am now on the new branch.

## 5. Modifying and committing and Pushing on a New Branch.
1. Added some new messages to the file that i have created called "hello.txt".

2. Again i have used `git status` , `git add .` , `git commit` to stage and commit the changes.

3. Used the 
`git push -u origin feature/additional-greeting` command to push the "feature/additional-greeting" branch to my GitHub repository.

## 6. Creating a Pull Request and Reviewing and Merging.
1. I came to my github repository and created a new pull Request it is very simple to created.

2. After all the review and inspection i merged the branch to the `main` branch.
